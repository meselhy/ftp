Messelhi's FTP

This FTP program has the below commands:
get          Download & view file
put		       Upload & view file
ls		       List files in directory
del		       Delete file
quit		     Exit

At the moment user can only login to the server using username and password: admin,admin. Other commands are under development.

ON CLIENT SIDE:
First you should compile the C file to be able to run it, to do so use this command line : gcc cs.c -o cs

ON SERVER SIDE:
You should compile the C file as well, to do so use this command line : gcc sc.c -o sc

Then use this command to run the file:  ./cs on client side and server side as well.



For any issues feel free to drop me a line.
